I am doing my Master's at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), and affiliated with Creativity, Greatness, Communication, and Love ([CGCL](http://grid.hust.edu.cn/index.htm)) Lab. I am preparing to apply for becoming a PhD student and looking for further studies starting from fall 2023.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on providing fundamental understandings of how Federated Learning (FL) is influenced by system-level variability in the computing infrastructure, and statistical variability in the training data. Inspired by the theoretical insights, I seek to design system- and data-aware distributed/federated training algorithms that can seamless scale to a large number of computing nodes in realistic secnarios.

I am broadly interested in federated learning, algorithm Robustness, distributed optimization, and medical image analysis.

Education
======
I was born and raised in Liping County, belonging to Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province, China. 
Before moving to HUST, I worked on different projects in my undergraduate years, and graduated with a B.S. degree in Information and Computing Science from the School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fu Zhou University, China, in June 2020. Before that I studied at Li Ping The First National Schools in Guizhou.
