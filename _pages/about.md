I was born and raised in [Liping County](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%BB%8E%E5%B9%B3%E5%8E%BF/424519?fr=aladdin), an enclave nestled in the luxuriant mountains of Guizhou, China. My hometown is famous for [Grand Song of Dong Minority](https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/silk-road-themes/intangible-cultural-heritage/grand-song-dong-ethnic-group) ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5Hp48-RNYE), [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DosPYXagLs8)), which is one of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. I'm looking forward to seeing you in my hometown.


Education
======
I am doing my Master's at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), and affiliated with Creativity, Greatness, Communication, and Love ([CGCL](http://grid.hust.edu.cn/index.htm)) Lab, AI Security and Privacy (AISP) Group.  Before moving to HUST, I worked on different projects in my undergraduate years, and graduated with a B.S. degree in Information and Computing Science from the School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fu Zhou University, China, in June 2020. Before that I studied at Li Ping The First National Schools in Guizhou.

**I am preparing to apply for a PHD and looking for further studies starting from fall 2023.**

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on providing fundamental understandings of how Federated Learning (FL) is influenced by system-level variability in the computing infrastructure, and statistical variability in the training data, under adversarial settings. Inspired by the theoretical or experimental insights, I seek to design system- and data-aware distributed/federated training algorithms that are byzantine-robust and superior in  generalization performance. In the future, I am committed to improving distributed/federated training algorithms that can seamlessly scale to a large number of computing nodes in realistic scenarios in terms of byzantine robustness, privacy preserving, communication/computation efficiency, and generalization performance.

I am broadly interested in federated learning, algorithm robustness, distributed optimization, and medical image analysis.
